# Factory method
Complexity : 1/3

Popularity : 3/3

The factory method is a design pattern that solves the problem of creating different products without specifying specific product classes.

> The factory method specifies the method to use instead of calling the operator "new" to create product objects. Sub-classes may override this method to change the type of products being created.
