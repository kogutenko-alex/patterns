***
An adapter is a structural pattern that allows incompatible objects to become friends.

> The adapter acts as a layer between two objects, transforming the calls of one into calls that are understandable to the other.
***
## Example of the above code
**Task**: Placement of square pegs in round holes

This simple example shows how a pattern adapter can combine incompatible things.

The [adapter](https://github.com/kogutenko-alex/patterns/blob/master/src/structurePatterns/adapterPattern/adapters/SquarePegAdapter.java) calculates the smallest radius of the circle into which a square peg can be inscribed and represents it as a round peg with this radius.
